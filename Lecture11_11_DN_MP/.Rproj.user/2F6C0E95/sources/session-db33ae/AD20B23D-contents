#  CSI 2300: Intro to Data Science

## In-Class Exercise 11: Data wrangling and cleaning

1.  Take a look at the script  
`readAudiLecture11.R` that creates the final **AudiA4** data frame. 

In the first line to read in the raw data,
``` 
AudiA4Raw <- scan("dat/rawCars.txt", what = "a", sep= "\n")
```
what is does ```sep="\n"``` do? What would happen if this was omitted?



2. See lines 56 to 62 in `readAudiLecture11.R` to explain how the variable  "distance to dealership" is being extracted from the raw data. One hint on understanding what is happening in a loop is to set `k <- 1`, and then run the lines inside of the loop.



3. **grep** refers to a UNIX function designed to do all kinds of matching of strings and uses some  characters that  have special meaning (known as a grep  *meta-character*). In particular the ```$```  by default in `grep` is used to match the end of a line.  Find the place in the `readAudiLecture11.R` script where the asking price is extracted, and explain how the dollar amount is matched as a dollar sign and not as a special `grep` meta-charcter. 


4. Load the `AudiA4.rda` data, and plot the asking price (y axis) against mileage (x axis), and
color the points by the model year.  Is there a straight line
relationship between price and mileage? Do you think adjusting
for both year and mileage will make much difference in predicting
the asking price?

To create a set of colors based on a variable here is one way
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(fields)
# this will map the years to 17 colors on the rainbow color range.
yearColors <- color.scale(AudiA4$year, col = rainbow(17))
```

Now in your plot commands use `col = yearColors` in the plot function to get symbols coded by these years. Seventeen colors may be too many, so you can experiment with the number of colors and the colors. 



5. For your plot in 4. are there any cars you would consider to be  outliers?  Any potential bargains?


6. Load the Corpus Christi radiosonde record, `CorpusCristi.rda`. 
Plot the **temp**, **windSpeed** and **windDir** variables at the *near surface* pressure level
 (the one equal to 925 mb) over time. To obtain the observations at 925 mb, one way is to use the logical
 
 `ind <- CorpusCristi$pressure == 925 `.

 Comment on any unusual values or patterns.


7. Do the missing values in temperature appear to be random across pressure levels, or do they follow a pattern?
