## Problem 1
Load the COVID data set and create a subset that is Boulders 
measured 'copies' 
Do this  by the R code:

```
covid <- read.csv(file = "dat/CDPHE_COVID19_Wastewater_Dashboard_Data.csv", header = T)
boulder_covid <- covid[covid$Utility == "Boulder", ]
RNATest<- na.omit( boulder_covid$SARS_CoV_2_copies_L )
```

* (A) What are the median and  mean for these RNA data? 
  Which is larger?
  
* (B) Plot a histogram of these data and locate the mean and median by vertical lines. (You can use the fields package function ```xline``` to to add the lines.)
* (C) Do any of the values  seem to  be outliers, i.e. unusual, worthy of scrutiny?
