# These examples (1-6) are from the first 3 lessons on the shiny app site.

# This is a really great resource and one you should look to use during your 
# shiny development. 

# Define UI ----
# Shiny uses the function fluidPage to create a display that automatically 
# adjusts to the dimensions of your user's browser window. You lay out the 
# user interface of your app by placing elements in the fluidPage function.
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # # 1
  # # Creates a user interface that has a title panel and a sidebar layout,
  # # which includes a sidebar panel and a main panel.
  # titlePanel("title panel"),
  # 
  # sidebarLayout(
  #   sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
  #   mainPanel("main panel")
  # )
  
  
  # # 2
  # # Sidebar always takes two arguments (sidebarPanel and mainPanel)
  # titlePanel("title panel"),
  # 
  # sidebarLayout(position = "right",
  #               sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
  #               mainPanel("main panel")
  # )
  
  
  # # 3
  # # Text will appear in the corresponding panel of your web page.
  # # You can place multiple elements in the same panel if you separate them with a comma.
  # titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  # sidebarLayout(
  #   sidebarPanel(),
  #   mainPanel(
  #     h1("First level title"),
  #     h2("Second level title"),
  #     h3("Third level title"),
  #     h4("Fourth level title"),
  #     h5("Fifth level title"),
  #     h6("Sixth level title")
  #   )
  # )

  # # Shiny offers many tag functions for formatting text.
  # # titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  # sidebarLayout(
  #   sidebarPanel(),
  #   mainPanel(
  #     p("p creates a paragraph of text."),
  #     p("A new p() command starts a new paragraph. Supply a style attribute to change the format of the entire paragraph.", style = "font-family: 'times'; font-si16pt"),
  #     strong("strong() makes bold text."),
  #     em("em() creates italicized (i.e, emphasized) text."),
  #     br(),
  #     code("code displays your text similar to computer code"),
  #     div("div creates segments of text with a similar style. This division of text is all blue because I passed the argument 'style = color:blue' to div", style = "color:blue"),
  #     br(),
  #     p("span does the same thing as div, but it works with",
  #       span("groups of words", style = "color:blue"),
  #       "that appear inside a paragraph.")
  #   )

  ## To insert an image, give the img function the name of your image file as the
  ## src argument (e.g., img(src = "my_image.png")). You must spell out this argument
  ## since img passes your input to an HTML tag, and src is what the tag expects.
  ## You can also include other HTML friendly parameters such as height and width.

  ## The img function looks for your image file in a specific place. Your file
  ## must be in a folder named www in the same directory as the app.R script.
   # titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
   # sidebarLayout(
   #   sidebarPanel(),
   #   mainPanel(
   #     img(src = "rstudio.png", height = 140, width = 400)
   #   )
